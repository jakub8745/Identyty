    tekst: `<section>The poster was created in response to the current global situation, which is the pandemic caused by the Covid-19. The virus has dominated our lives and caused us fear and many negative emotions. Through this poster, I wanted to show that despite the fact that the virus has created huge confusion in our daily lives, we should smile. Let us try to look into the future with the hope that it will be normal, and it will be beautiful. It is important to accept the current situation and to live as fully as possible despite the existing restrictions. In such difficult times, we need as many smiles as possible. The form of the poster is minimalistic and positive, and therefore reaches a broader audience to stir their emotions. </section>`

    tekst: `<section>In today’s tumultuous and chaotically moving world, people are trying to express themselves, their desires, ideas and thoughts towards certain events, whether it’s an ecological, political or social situation. Of course, the ruling powers are always trying to stir things up, mix them up and change the news. As a result, we have constant turbulence and rotation of news from all platforms of mass media. There is only one thing that can stop all this chaos and finally make people’s voices heard, and that is RESISTANCE. When we look at this poster from a close distance, a close perspective, we can’t see the letters, only the chaos of turbulent lines, just like fragments of thin paper strips or wires of the media twisted like a spiral. But when we look at it from a distance, amidst these twisted lines we start noticing the word RESISTANCE, it starts gradually appearing like the free voice of people coming through the constant spiral of the modern mass media. This keyword speaks for itself — from the right people, through the right people and for the good people around the world.</section>`

This poster presents a visual metaphor for the need to wake up to the real world. The main motif of the poster is a pacifier, the soft part of it is replaced by a cactus plant. The primary purpose of the pacifier is to calm down a baby.

    The poster uses cranes and humans as positive and negative graphics. The head of the crane is bleeding, conveying the concept of protecting endangered species and that the protection of wild animals starts with us, and calling for the harmonious coexistence of humans, animals and nature.

Names of black American citizens are written between the stripes, their age of death between the brackets. The list seems endless. They were all killed by white people, mostly police officers who represent the law, often seen as heroes. They were killed because they were black. We shall not forget their names. The Black Lives Matter movement rose again this year, and people have been protesting despite the sanitary restrictions. Like many others, I educated myself on anti-racism through social media and learned all the things that school never tells us. This tragedy was a wake-up call for many of us.</section>`

Being trapped at home and having to work remotely, the empty streets, the cancelled academic courses and cultural events – all this helped me to rethink the meanings we attach to our everyday lives. I was directly inspired by the song “Time” (“Czas”) performed by a new Polish band called UDW (Ukrytedowiadomości).</section>`

These apps are not only a convenient medium for people to communicate but also an important place for people to get information every day. The development of the Internet has caused a flood of information, and people are besieged with endless information. In many cases, what we see may not be true. There may be pitfalls hidden behind various topics. Our thoughts are easily manipulated and guided by various media. When the truth is revealed, it becomes difficult for people to trust the media.</section>`
